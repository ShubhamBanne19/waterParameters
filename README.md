# waterParameters
created an application that collects data from an Arduino device installed in a water  pond. The application collects parameters such as pH, temperature, and dissolved oxygen.  This data is then stored in a MongoDB database in CSV format. A dashboard retrieves the CSV data and presents it in both a tabular form and a line chart.
